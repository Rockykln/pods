# Installing podctl

podctl is distro-agnostic: a static-ish Rust binary that drives the
standard Linux stack (BlueZ, PipeWire/PulseAudio, D-Bus, systemd-user).
There is nothing distro-specific in the code — only the handful of CLI
tools it shells out to need to be present.

## Requirements

- A Linux kernel with Bluetooth + L2CAP (every mainstream kernel; the
  AAP link uses a raw `AF_BLUETOOTH` SEQPACKET socket on PSM 0x1001).
- BlueZ 5.x with `bluetoothctl` and a paired Bluetooth adapter.
- A D-Bus **system** bus (BlueZ) and, for the tray/popup, a **session**
  bus.
- For the audio verbs (`volume`, `mute`, `profile`, `codec`, …):
  PipeWire (with the PulseAudio shim) **or** PulseAudio — podctl talks to
  `pactl`.
- For `podctl meter`: `parec` (ships with PulseAudio utils; present on
  PipeWire systems via the pulseaudio-utils package).
- To build from source: Rust ≥ 1.89 (edition 2024) and a C linker
  (`cc`/`gcc`).

Core control (battery, listening mode, conversation awareness,
connect/pair) needs only BlueZ + the kernel. Audio features degrade
cleanly with a clear message if `pactl` is absent; `podctl meter` says so
if `parec` is missing.

## Runtime tools podctl invokes

| Tool | Package (typical) | Needed for |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `bluetoothctl` | bluez / bluez-utils | everything (device + AAP) |
| `dbus-send` | dbus | `podctl rename` |
| `pactl` | pipewire-pulse *or* pulseaudio-utils | audio verbs |
| `parec` | pulseaudio-utils | `podctl meter` |
| `systemctl` | systemd | `podctl install`/`reboot` user services |

## Dependencies per distro

Build deps (`rust`, `cargo`, a linker) are only needed to compile; a
prebuilt binary needs just the runtime tools above.

**Arch / CachyOS / Manjaro**
```
sudo pacman -S --needed rust bluez-utils dbus
# Audio + meter:
#   - PipeWire systems: sudo pacman -S --needed pipewire-pulse  (provides pactl + parec)
#   - PulseAudio systems: sudo pacman -S --needed libpulse pulseaudio
```

**Debian / Ubuntu / Mint**
```
sudo apt install cargo bluez dbus pipewire-pulse pulseaudio-utils
# (pulseaudio-utils provides pactl + parec; on a PulseAudio box it is
#  the same package)
```

**Fedora**
```
sudo dnf install cargo bluez dbus pipewire-pulseaudio pulseaudio-utils
```

**openSUSE**
```
sudo zypper install cargo bluez dbus-1 pipewire-pulseaudio pulseaudio-utils
```

If your Rust is older than 1.89, install a current toolchain via
[rustup](https://rustup.rs) — distro Rust is often behind, and cargo
will otherwise stop with a clear `rust-version` error.

## Build and install

```
git clone https://github.com/Rockykln/podctl && cd podctl
cargo build --release
./target/release/podctl install            # core (CLI + daemon)
./target/release/podctl install --with-tray --with-popup
```

`podctl install` is interactive and needs no root. It copies the binaries
to `~/.local/bin/`, installs shell completion (bash/zsh/fish, picked
from `$SHELL`), man pages, and — if you accept — a systemd **user**
service for the daemon (and tray/popup with the flags). It is
idempotent; re-running it is safe. `podctl uninstall` removes everything
it created.

If `~/.local/bin` is not on `$PATH`, the installer prints the exact
line for your shell rc.

`podctl reboot` restarts the installed user services after an update.

## Optional components

`--with-tray` installs `podctl-tray`, a StatusNotifierItem. It needs a
tray host on the session bus:

| Desktop | Tray |
| --- | --- |
| KDE Plasma | native |
| Hyprland / sway / river + waybar | yes (`tray` module) |
| Xfce / MATE / LXQt | yes |
| GNOME | needs the *AppIndicator/KStatusNotifier* extension; `podctl tray status` says so |

`--with-popup` installs `podctl-popup`, the case-open bubble. Backend is
auto-detected:

| Session | Popup backend |
| --- | --- |
| Wayland with `wlr-layer-shell` (Hyprland, sway, river, KDE Plasma, Wayfire) | full animated bubble |
| GNOME Wayland (no layer-shell) | notification fallback |
| X11 (i3, Xfce, MATE, …) | override-redirect window |

## Multi-adapter hosts

If `/sys/class/bluetooth` lists more than one `hci*` device and the
default (first enumerated) is the wrong one for AirPods, pin the
adapter explicitly:

```
export PODCTL_ADAPTER=hci1
```

The variable is read by `podctl rename` (D-Bus path resolution) and by
any future code that needs an adapter id. Bluez itself still routes
based on which adapter holds the paired device, so `connect` /
`disconnect` aren't affected.

## Optional: tell BlueZ the host is an Apple device

A handful of AirPods features (most notably end-to-end Find My handoff
and some Beats-specific toggles) only light up when the bud believes
it's paired to a Mac. Linux can advertise itself as Apple's vendor ID
by adding a single line to `/etc/bluetooth/main.conf`:

```ini
[General]
DeviceID = bluetooth:004C:0000:0000
```

Then `sudo systemctl restart bluetooth` and re-pair. This is a
host-wide change — *every* Bluetooth device sees the new vendor ID, so
verify your other peripherals still pair correctly afterwards. podctl
works without it; this is purely for the extras.

## Troubleshooting

- "pactl not in PATH" → install the PulseAudio-utils / pipewire-pulse
  package for your distro (table above). Core control still works
  without it.
- "bluetoothctl … failed" → ensure `bluetooth.service` is running and
  the AirPods are paired (`podctl list`).
- Tray invisible on GNOME → install the AppIndicator extension; verify
  with `podctl tray status`.
- `man podctl` not found → the installer prints the `MANPATH` line if
  `~/.local/share/man` is outside your manpath.
- Conversation Awareness only reacts while audio is playing — that is
  the device's own behaviour, not a podctl limitation.
